Some notes from the book about the origin of eliza

Geneology: ELIZA was originally programed in LISP by Joseph
Weizenbaum at MIT. It was converted to BASIC by Jeff Shrager
and furture modified to work with Microsoft BASIC by Steve 
North. 

I believe Steve North wrote the BASIC program in the book.

This program has dependancies on libraries in this repository:
